Day 1 - Generating synthetic data
Lecture 1 - What is synthetic data - 45 min
- The general idea: What is it, what can it be used for?
- Link with traditional sdc approaches
- Link with missing data imputation
- The privacy-utility trade-off (different use-cases require different approaches)
- The link with data simulation

5 minute break

Practical 1 - A simple data generation example - 60 minutes
- Introduction to data generation: `rnorm()`, `rbinom()`
- Low-level introduction to fully conditional specification: three level sequential procedure.
- Discussion

15 minute break

Lecture 2 - Generating synthetic data - 45 minutes
- Distinction between fully and partially synthetic data: Rubin 1987, impute the population.
- The general idea: decide which variables to synthesize; sequential prediction models to create synthetic values (i.e., sequential regression/fully conditional specification)
- Sequential regression / fully conditional specification
- Advantages and disadvantages

5 minute break
